# London Bike Shares
This project aimed to get more hands-on practice with what you can do with data. The dataset's purpose is to try to predict future bike shares and I used it to practice:
- Gathering data using Python and Kaggle API
- With the Pandas library, I manipulated the data to what I needed
- Created an interactive dashboard using Tableau

## What I learned
- There are many ways to display the data, but a select few to effectively present it
- I got more familiar with using Python and the Pandas library
